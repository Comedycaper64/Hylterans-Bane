  sentences:
  - A light breeze blows across the Cyanic Plains, causing its curious, cyan-tinted
    grass to sway and ripple like the surface of a pond.
  - Nobody is certain why the Plains have such an unusual colour.
  - Many old texts mention some kind of magical mistake made in the age of Old Vaeloris,
    long before the Fell God dropped from the sky, but nothing has ever been confirmed.
  - Being arid for half of the year, the land barely provides enough food to sustain
    Farzorn. Nevertheless, the grass remains thick year-round.
  - Today, if you were to look closely, you might just make out a figure slinking
    through that grass.
  - Crown Prince Cyneric silently stalks back to the group, knowing exactly where
    to step to avoid making a sound.
  - "He\u2019s always been good at treading quietly. His nanny used to call him \u201CTwinkletoes\u201D
    as he developed a habit of sneaking up behind her and making her jump."
  - "\u201CNext time I catch you tiptoeing around it\u2019ll be straight to bed with
    no supper, young prince!\u201D she used to threaten, a knowing smile betraying
    her stern fa\xE7ade every time."
  - 'Today, the consequences of being caught are much more serious.

    As he makes
    it back to camp, the High Mage starts hobbling over to him.'
